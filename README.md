# Random Password Generator

## Description

This is a web application that creates a randomly generated password based on criteria such as length and character type. These criteria are dictated by alerts given to the user.  

This site is a project for me to show my skill and ability to use the javascript programming language.

## Installation

The website is hosted with github pages and can be accessed at [this link](https://blakee-37.github.io/Challenge-2/)

Below is an image of the loaded website.

## Usage

Click the button and then input each criteria as the alerts pop-up. A password will then be generated based on that criteria and displayed on the front page.
